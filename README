Unfinished Bad Apple demo for the Dreamcast VMU.

Contains a fully functional compressed video.  The framerate
could be higher, but the VMU only gives us 100KB to work with.
Some space was reserved for sound, which never came.

The compression algorithm is nifty.  
See badapple/1bpp_compress.py for a description.

I'd love to see this done!  Feel free to poke me if you want
to pick this up.
